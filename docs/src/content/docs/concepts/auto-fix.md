title: Auto-Fix Loop
description: How the automatic fix loop works.
---

When a pipeline step finds issues, `no-mistakes` can automatically ask the agent to fix them before pausing for your approval. This is controlled by the `auto_fix` configuration.

  run["Run step"] --> findings{"Findings?"}
  findings -- "no" --> done["Step completes"]
  findings -- "yes" --> eligible{"Auto-fix enabled and eligible findings?"}
  eligible -- "no" --> pause["Pause for user approval"]
  eligible -- "yes" --> fix["Agent applies fixes"]
  fix --> rerun["Re-run step"]
  rerun --> clean{"Blocking findings remain?"}
  clean -- "no" --> done
  clean -- "yes, attempts left" --> eligible
  clean -- "yes, limit hit" --> pause
```

## How it works

1. A step executes and returns findings (e.g., test failures, lint warnings, review issues)
2. If `auto_fix` is enabled for that step (limit > 0) and the attempt count is below the limit, the executor re-runs the step with `fixing=true`
3. The agent receives the previous findings and applies fixes
4. The step re-runs to verify the fixes
5. If issues remain and attempts are left, the loop continues
6. Once the limit is reached or all issues are resolved:
   - If issues remain, the step pauses for user approval
   - If everything passes, the step completes and the pipeline moves on

Two steps apply fixes during their initial pass instead of relying on a follow-up automatic fix loop.
When `commands.lint` is empty, the agent detects relevant linters and formatters, applies safe fixes, verifies them, and commits any changes during the initial lint pass.
The document step finds documentation gaps, updates docs or doc comments for every gap it can resolve, verifies the edits, and commits any documentation changes during the initial document pass.
Unresolved findings from either pass pause for approval instead of entering another automatic fix loop.

## Configuration

Set limits in global or repo config:

```yaml
auto_fix:
  rebase: 3
  review: 0    # disabled by default, requires manual approval
  test: 3
  document: 3
  lint: 3
  ci: 3        # shared by CI for failures, and on GitHub/GitLab for merge conflicts
```

Setting a step to `0` disables the follow-up auto-fix loop, so the pipeline pauses for human input when that step finds issues.
The document step does not use this limit for automatic follow-up loops because it attempts documentation fixes during its initial pass.
For empty `commands.lint`, the initial lint pass can still apply safe fixes before reporting unresolved issues.

`auto_fix.review` defaults to `0`, so review findings require manual approval unless you opt in.

`auto_fix.ci` applies to the CI step. The same limit covers CI-failure fixes for supported providers, plus merge-conflict fixes on GitHub and GitLab.

Repo config overlays global config - you can set `auto_fix.lint: 5` in a repo's `.no-mistakes.yaml` to override just that step while inheriting the rest from global.

## Finding actions

Agent-driven findings now use an `action` field instead of `requires_human_review`:

- `auto-fix` - objective issues that can be fixed automatically
- `ask-user` - intent-sensitive or ambiguous issues that pause for approval instead of entering the normal auto-fix loop
- `no-op` - informational notes that do not need a fix

`ask-user` is meant for findings that need human judgment - for example, questioning an intentional product or design choice, arguing that an intentional addition, removal, or guard should be undone, or reporting that the test step could not produce enough evidence for the available intent. Routine correctness, reliability, or security fixes still stay `auto-fix` even if the smallest fix reintroduces a small amount of previously deleted logic. Agents driving the AXI skill should relay `ask-user` findings to the user unless they have explicit `--yes` consent to resolve gates unattended.
In the TUI, yolo mode is an explicit override that auto-resolves paused steps by treating `auto-fix` and `ask-user` findings as consent to run one fix round.
Steps with only `no-op` findings are approved as-is.

The `review`, `test`, and configured-command `lint` steps use this shared model directly. The `document` step also uses the same `action` field, but unresolved documentation findings pause for approval because the initial document pass already attempted the documentation updates it could make safely.
When `commands.lint` is empty, lint findings describe issues left after the agent already attempted safe fixes, so they pause for approval instead of remaining eligible for another automatic fix loop.

Documentation findings use the same approval UI, but the `document` step treats any finding as an unresolved documentation gap or judgment call that should pause for approval.

## User-triggered fixes

When the pipeline pauses for approval, you can manually trigger a fix from the TUI or AXI interface:

1. The findings panel shows all findings with checkboxes
2. Toggle individual findings with `space`, or use `A` (all) / `N` (none)
3. Optionally press `e` to attach a note to the current finding, or `+` to add your own finding to the fix request
4. Press `f` to fix the selected findings

The agent receives the merged fix payload for that round: the selected agent findings, any per-finding user notes, any selected user-authored findings added from the TUI or AXI interface, and a sanitized history of previous rounds for that step.
That history includes which finding IDs were selected for a prior fix attempt, which findings were left unselected by the user, and any one-line summaries from earlier fix commits.
On follow-up review passes, that history tells the agent not to re-report user-ignored findings unless the code now presents a materially different issue.

After a user-triggered fix, the step re-runs and pauses again to show you the results (`fix_review` status). You can then approve, fix again, skip, or abort.
Yolo and AXI `--yes` approve that fix review automatically after their one fix round, so a finding that remains after the fix does not trigger an unbounded fix loop.

## Fix commits

Each auto-fix cycle commits its changes with a descriptive message. Agent-managed initial passes that apply safe fixes, such as Document and empty-command Lint, use the same step-specific prefixes:

| Step | Commit prefix |
|---|---|
| Rebase | `no-mistakes(rebase): <summary>` |
| Review | `no-mistakes(review): <summary>` |
| Test | `no-mistakes(test): <summary>` |
| Document | `no-mistakes(document): <summary>` |
| Lint | `no-mistakes(lint): <summary>` |

The push step commits any remaining uncommitted changes with `no-mistakes: apply agent fixes`.

## Step rounds

Each execution of a step (initial run or follow-up auto-fix run) is recorded as a "round" in the database.
A round stores its findings, duration, any selected finding IDs and whether that selection came from the user or auto-fix filtering, the merged finding payload actually sent to the fix agent for that round, and any one-line fix summary from that execution.
That merged payload can include per-finding user notes and user-authored findings added from the TUI or AXI interface.
The PR body's deterministic risk assessment, testing, and pipeline sections are built from these rounds, giving reviewers visibility into test results, review risk, what was fixed, and how many attempts it took.
In PR pipeline details, auto-fix rounds are rendered as an issue -> fix -> verification narrative instead of a round-numbered log: each fix summary is followed by either a successful re-check or the findings still open after that fix.

Round trigger types:
- `initial` - first execution
- `auto_fix` - triggered by the automatic fix loop
- `auto_fix` - also used when you press `f` in the TUI or use `no-mistakes axi respond --action fix` to run a follow-up fix

Legacy `user_fix` rounds are still rendered as `auto-fix` in PR summaries for backward compatibility.
